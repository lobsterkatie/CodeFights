AT THE CROSSROADS / ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION

Consider an arithmetic expression of the form A#B=C. Check whether it is
possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or / to obtain a
correct expression.

Example

    For A = 2, B = 3 and C = 5, the output should be
    arithmeticExpression(A, B, C) = true.

    We can replace # with a + to obtain 2 + 3 = 5, so the answer is true.

    For A = 8, B = 2 and C = 4, the output should be
    arithmeticExpression(A, B, C) = true.

    We can replace # with a / to obtain 8 / 2 = 4, so the answer is true.

    For A = 8, B = 3 and C = 2, the output should be
    arithmeticExpression(A, B, C) = false.

    8 + 3 = 11 ≠ 2;
    8 - 3 = 5 ≠ 2;
    8 * 3 = 24 ≠ 2;
    8 / 3 = 2.(6) ≠ 2.
    So the answer is false.

Input/Output

    [input] integer A

        Constraints:
        1 ≤ A ≤ 10.

    [input] integer B

        Constraints:
        1 ≤ B ≤ 10.

    [input] integer C

        Constraints:
        0 ≤ C ≤ 10.

    [output] boolean

        true if the desired replacement is possible, false otherwise.
